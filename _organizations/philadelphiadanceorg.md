description: PhiladelphiaDANCE.org was established in 2005 as a resource and hub for
  dance related information, advocacy and service in the greater Philadelphia region.
  At the core of its mission is the expansion and development of new audiences for
  dance through education, marketing, outreach, networking and use of current technologies.
  PhiladelphiaDANCE.org seeks to promote to the public the wealth of dance experiences
  available in the region. In addition, PhiladelphiaDANCE.org strives to bring together
  resources and information required by dancers, dance companies, choreographers,
  dance writers, dance organizations, dance practitioners, audiences, media, philanthropists
  and policy makers. By facilitating collaboration between these entities, it is our
  hope to create an even stronger dance community and presence for dance and the arts
  in Philadelphia. http://philadelphiadance.org/
