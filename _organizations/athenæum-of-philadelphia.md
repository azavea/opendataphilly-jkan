description: The Athenaeum of Philadelphia is an independent member-supported library
  and museum. The Athenaeum was founded in 1814 to collect materials "connected with
  the history and antiquities of America, and the useful arts, and generally to disseminate
  useful knowledge" for public benefit. It provides the Philadelphia region with a
  resource of first resort on matters of architecture and interior design history,
  particularly for the period 1800 to 1945. http://www.philaathenaeum.org
