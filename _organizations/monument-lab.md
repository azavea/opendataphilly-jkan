description: 'Monument Lab is a national public art and history project based in Philadelphia.
  Our goal is to critically engage the monuments we have inherited and unearth the
  next generation of monuments through stories of social justice and solidarity. We
  work with artists, activists, municipal agencies, and civic stakeholders on creative
  approaches to public art, history, and memory. Through public art exhibitions, participatory
  research projects, a national fellows program, and a new website and podcast, Monument
  Lab is building research and creating conversations around the past, present, and
  future of monuments. '
