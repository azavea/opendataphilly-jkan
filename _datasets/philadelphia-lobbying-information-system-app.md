notes: "The Philadelphia Lobbying Information System is a searchable database of registered\
  \ lobbyists, principals and lobbying firms as well as lobbying expenses\r\n\r\n\
  The data was collected to comply with City Code Chapter 20-1200 (and Board Regulation\
  \ No. 9) and more generally to provide the public insight as to the outside interests\
  \ who speak with City government officials to influence policy.  Data was submitted\
  \ to PLIS by lobbyists, lobbying firms, and principals.  The intended audience for\
  \ this data is anyone with an interest in the people lobbying City government. \
  \ The data collected by PLIS is a public record intended to make the legislative\
  \ and executive process more transparent by providing the public with a clear picture\
  \ of all of the outside interests involved in policy discussions.\r\n\r\nTrouble\

  \ Discussion Group](http://www.phila.gov/data/discuss/)"
