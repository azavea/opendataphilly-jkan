notes: "Data about real estate with tax balances by ZIP code, city council district, or census tract. The datasets include properties in a payment agreement. An overdue balance means a property owner owes a balance in the current tax year (March 31 - December 31) but it is not yet considered delinquent. Tax delinquencies are those that are delinquent from previous tax years. An account is delinquent when the real estate tax is still unpaid on January 1 of the following year that the tax was due."
