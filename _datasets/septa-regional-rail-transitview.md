notes: "Regional Rail TransitView provides access to real-time information about SEPTA\
  \ regional rail trains. Users can access the information as a KML file or JSON feed\
  \ or view the information on a Google Map or SEPTA system map. The information includes\
  \ the train number, its current location, and possible delays.   \r\n<br></br>\r\
  \nThese APIs and applications were created as part of the Apps for SEPTA hackathon.\
  \ \r\n<br></br>\r\nAs of March 16, 2012, SEPTA has decommissioned TransitView. The\
  \ data feeds remain available, however, and the URLs listed below are still active. "
