notes: "Certain buildings in the City of Philadelphia require periodic inspections.\
  \ These inspections are performed by licensed inspection companies. Buildings that\
  \ contain fire sprinkler systems or hard-wired fire alarm systems must have these\
  \ systems inspected annually. Buildings over 60 feet must have their fa\xE7ade inspected\
  \ every five years. Buildings with fire escapes or private bridges must have these\
  \ structures inspected every five years. Non-vacant piers must be inspected every\
  \ three years. The Department of Licenses and Inspections collects certifications\
  \ documenting the conditions of these structures and enforces the requirements that\
  \ property owners file these certifications with the Department and repair any structural\
  \ issues or system deficiencies identified during the corresponding inspection.\
  \ This dataset contains records related to these building certifications.\r\n\r\n\
  You can find out more information about [fire protection certifications](https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-licenses-and-inspections/inspections/fire-protection-certifications/)\
  \ and [maintenance inspections](https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-licenses-and-inspections/inspections/maintenance-inspections/).\r\
