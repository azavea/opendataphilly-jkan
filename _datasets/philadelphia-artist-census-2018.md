notes: In the Summer of 2018, PhillyStewards released the Philly Artist Census for
  three months in an attempt to get an accurate picture of the resources, challenges
  and livelihoods of practicing visual artists in Philadelphia. Our motivation to
  assemble this information was and continues to be to clarify myths from truths about
  the greater Philly artist community.  We received over 500 responses from the Philadelphia
  artist community.
