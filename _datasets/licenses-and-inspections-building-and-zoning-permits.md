notes: "The Department of Licenses & Inspections reviews construction plans and conducts\
  \ building inspections to ensure the safety of the workers and the public. \r\n\r\
  \n[Zoning permits](https://business.phila.gov/zoning-basics/) are issued to authorize\
  \ new construction or additions to a building or to authorize the change of use\
  \ in a building or ground.  \r\n\r\n[Building permits](https://www.phila.gov/services/permits-violations-licenses/build-rent-or-sell-a-property/get-a-building-permit/)\
  \ are required before the start of a specific construction activity to enlarge,\
  \ repair, change, add to or demolish a structure, and to install equipment or systems\
  \ in a structure.  Depending on the scale or type of construction activity, it may\
  \ need to be first authorized via a zoning permit. Plumbing and electrical permits,\
  \ among others, may also be required for new or existing buildings.\r\n\r\n**Please\
  \ note that this is a very large dataset. To see all permits, download all datasets\
  \ for all years.** \r\n\r\n**If you are comfortable with APIs, you can also use\
  \ the API links to access this data. You can learn more about how to use the API\
  \ at Carto\u2019s SQL API site and in the Carto guide in the section on making calls\
  \ to the API.**\r\n\r\nTrouble downloading or have questions about this City dataset?\
