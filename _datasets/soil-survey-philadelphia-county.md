notes: "A digital survey of the types and distributions of soils on the landscape\
  \ of Philadelphia County in 2005, developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's\
  \ Natural Resource Conservation Service through its Soil Survey Geographic database\
  \ (SSURGO). Consists of geo-referenced digital maps and attribute data. Includes\
  \ an optional soil features map layer for features too small to delineate at the\
  \ mapping scale but large and contrasting enough to significantly influence land\
  \ use and management. Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other\
  \ associated layers are not part of SSURGO data and are thus not featured.\r\n"
