notes: "Please note that the enterprise zones expired in the early 2000s, therefore\
  \ this dataset has been archived, and will not be updated, but remains for historical\
  \ analysis purposes.\r\n\r\nData includes commercial and industrial zones, i.e.\
  \ areas with specific federal enterprise zone designation meant to attract and support\
  \ businesses in blighted areas. Blighted areas are defined as meeting one of seven\
  \ city mandated criteria, including unsafe, unsanitary and inadequate conditions;\
  \ economically or socially undesirable land use; and faulty street and lot layout."
