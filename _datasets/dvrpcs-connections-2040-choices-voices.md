notes: "Choices & Voices version 2.1 allows you to participate in developing a vision\
  \ for growth and development in Greater Philadelphia between now and 2040. Identify\
  \ your preferred development pattern, and then select regional funding levels and\
  \ major transportation projects that you would like to see happen over the next\
  \ 27 years. This application is crowdsourced, so you'll be able to compare your\
  \ scenario to the vision created by all other participants.\r\n\r\nThis version\
  \ of Choices & Voices has been updated to correspond with the recently amended Connections\
  \ 2040 Plan for Greater Philadelphia. This amendment reflects transportation increased\
  \ funding levels in Pennsylvania from the passage of Act 89 of 2013. \r\n\r\nChoices\
  \ & Voices was a winner of the U.S. DOT 2014 Data Innovation Challenge. "
