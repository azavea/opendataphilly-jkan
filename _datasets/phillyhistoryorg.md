  \ of the City of Philadelphia Department of Records, the database contains images\
  \ dating back to the 1850s and can be searched by geographic criteria such as address,\
  \ intersection, place name, and neighborhood as well as keyword, date, collection,\
  \ topics, and other criteria. Images and maps are associated with a location using\
  \ the database's geocoding feature. Users can create a free account to save images,\
  \ bookmark searches, and submit error reports.\r\n\r\nTrouble downloading or have\
