notes: "OHCD has long supported neighborhood-based and citywide organizations offering\
  \ housing counseling services to low- and moderate-income people. OHCD-funded services\
  \ provided by these agencies include mortgage counseling, default and delinquency\
  \ counseling, tenant support and housing consumer education. Through these services\
  \ prospective homeowners can avoid predatory loans, a significant cause of foreclosure.\r\
