notes: 'This dataset is based on Office of Property Assessment Records to aid the
  public in correctly identifying property addresses (speeding up complaints to City
  officials, researching property records, etc.). This dataset is particularly useful
  for locating parcel addresses with blighted/vacant land where property lines are
  not easily visible from the ground. '
