notes: 'SEPTA SMS Transit enables users to request scheduled trip information via 
  text message. Users subscribe to the service via text. After setting up an account, 
  users can receive schedule information by texting the Stop ID number for a bus, 
  trolley, or subway stop to 41411. They will receive a return text with information 
  on the four next scheduled trips from that stop. Users can include the specific 
  route designation in the text to receive information on a certain route if the 
  stop serves multiple routes.
  In addition to using the SMS, there 
  is also a simulator which people can use to experiment at no cost. 
  
  Finally, the SMS data can be accessed from an API.  The data returned by the API
  is currently text format, separated.  The API can be accessed in the format:
  https://www3.septa.org/sms/var1/var2/var3/var4/var5  <br>
