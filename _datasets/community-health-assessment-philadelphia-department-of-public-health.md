notes: "The Community Health Assessment (CHA) is a systematic assessment of population\
  \ health in Philadelphia, highlighting key public health challenges and assets and\
  \ informing local public health programs, policies, and partnerships. The CHA includes\
  \ indicators reflecting health behaviors, health conditions, health care factors,\
  \ and social and environmental determinants of health. The Philadelphia Department\
  \ of Public Health publishes an annual report of the analyses, linked to under the\
  \ 'Related' tab. Additionally, they have released an online, interactive version\
  \ of the CHA, known as the Community Health Explorer, to make the data more accessible\
  \ to a broader audience: http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/community-health-explorer/\r\n\r\n\r\n"
