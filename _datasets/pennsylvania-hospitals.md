notes: 'The PA_Hospitals layer contains the latitude and longitude coordinates of
  249 hospitals in Pennsylvania. When possible, efforts were made to confirm the rooftop
  location of each hospital. The accuracy of geocoding is available in Geocoding Certainty
  attribute field (Geocoding Certainty: Rooftop="00", Street="01", Zip Centroid="04",
  Not geocoded="99"). Latitude and longitude are recorded in the WGS 1984 coordinate
  system in decimal degrees. The attribute data were obtained from an annual hospital
  survey and include approximately 19 fields such as survey ID number, longitude,
  latitude, facility name, etc. Additional fields and data items could be potentially
  linked to this layer. '
