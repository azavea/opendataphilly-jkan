notes: "TransitView provides real-time information about SEPTA buses and trolleys.\
  \ Users can select a bus route or trolley line to view the current location of the\
  \ bus or trolley vehicles in service on that route. Clicking on a vehicle displays\
  \ the identification numbers for that vehicle, the direction it is traveling, and\
  \ any service alerts for that route. Vehicles transmit information on their locations\
  \ every three minutes and TransitView updates continuously. \r\n<br></br>\r\nAs\
  \ of March 16, 2012, SEPTA TransitView has been integrated into the SEPTA System\
  \ Status application. To view real-time data, users can click on the TransitView\
  \ icon located next to a bus route number or the name of a trolley or train line."
