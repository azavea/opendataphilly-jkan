notes: "The Philadelphia Land Cover Raster provides data on the types of surfaces\
  \ in Philadelphia in 2008. The data identifies seven categories: tree canopy, grass/shrub,\
  \ bare earth, water, buildings, roads, other paved surfaces. The data primarily\
  \ was intended to demonstrate tree canopy levels in Philadelphia. When tree canopy\
  \ covers another surface type, that area is placed in the tree canopy category.\
  \ The data was gathered with the assistance of the University of Vermont Spatial\
  \ Analysis Laboratory.\r\n\r\nTrouble downloading or have questions about this City\
  \ dataset? Visit the [OpenDataPhilly Discussion Group](http://www.phila.gov/data/discuss/)"
