notes: "A dataset of free COVID-19 testing sites. \r\n\r\n__If looking for a test,\
  \ please use the [Testing Sites locator app](https://www.phila.gov/covid-testing-sites/#/).__\
  \ \u200BNo testing site will ask you for money. You will be asked for identification\
  \ and may also be asked for health insurance information. If you don\u2019t have\
  \ identification or health insurance, you can still get a test. In addition, some\
  \ sites may:\r\n* Limit testing to people who meet certain criteria.\r\n* Require\
  \ an appointment.\r\n* Require a referral from your doctor.\r\n* Ask you to stay\
  \ in your car (for drive-thru sites).\r\n\r\nCheck a location\u2019s specific details\
  \ on the map. Then, call or visit the provider's website before going for a test.\r\
