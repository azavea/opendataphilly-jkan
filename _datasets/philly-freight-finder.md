notes: "Freight Data Portal for the Delaware Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Valley is\
  \ a premier freight transportation gateway. It possesses one of the world's busiest\
  \ freshwater ports; rail freight service from two large Class I railroads and 12\
  \ smaller short lines; an airport with expanding international cargo services; an\
  \ excellent highway and connector network; and numerous rail and port intermodal\
  \ terminals.\r\n\r\nThe performance of this extraordinary network helps promote\
  \ and support a thriving economy. PhillyFreightFinder is a resource for exploring\
  \ and tracking the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton regional freight network.\r\n\r\n\
  Open Freight App is a project by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission\
  \ (DVRPC) to share with regional and national transportation planning partners the\
  \ framework that is the basis for the PhillyFreightFinder web mapping and data application.\
  \ Through this effort, DVRPC hopes that county planning agencies, metropolitan planning\
  \ organizations and state departments of transportation, and economic development\
  \ agencies can leverage this framework to further their efforts in making freight\
  \ transportation data public. By utilizing the Open Freight App framework, rather\
  \ than building from scratch, planning agencies can focus their time and resources\
  \ on the development of data sets that can serve to improve the access to information\
  \ on freight facilities and their role in economic development and transportation\
  \ across the country. Open Freight App would serve as a self-hosted solution to\
  \ offer these datasets to other planners, economic developers, public officials,\
  \ decision-makers and the general public."
