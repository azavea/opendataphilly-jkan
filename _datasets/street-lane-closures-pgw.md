notes: "This is an API for querying street lane closures made by PGW for maintenance\
  \ and repair of the gas network.  There are two methods on the SOAP endpoint, one\
  \ for retrieving a list of historical closures for a period of dates (earliest time\
  \ period is December 2009) and one for returning details about specific current\
  \ closures.  Both methods return data for the Project Number, Address, EUN Number,\
  \ Construction Start/End date, reason for the work, degree of closure, and contact\
  \ information for the responsible party at PGW.\r\n"
