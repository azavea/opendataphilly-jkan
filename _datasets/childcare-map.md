    \r\nChildcare Supply, Demand and Shortage Data\r\nThere is no single data source\
    \ that permits the adequate modeling of the supply and quality of child care.\
    \ Nor is there a single source of data that indicates the demand for childcare\
    \ services. And where demand data exist, it is inadequate because there is no\
    \ clear indication of which children are in child care and which are not; which\
    \ are in child care near where their parents live or near where they work. Because\
    \ of this, TRF statistically estimated both the supply of and demand for child\
    \ care by combining data from several different databases to best approximate\
    \ both sides of the supply/demand equation.\r\n\r\nThe shortage in child care\
    \ was measured generally in two ways: absolute and relative. The absolute shortage\
    \ is the raw difference between supply and demand. The relative shortage is a\
    \ measure that makes statistical adjustments for existing shortages in the market.\r\
    \n\r\nAbsolute and relative shortages were subdivided to offer specific gap measures\
    \ for total supply, certified supply and high-quality supply (defined as centers\
    \ with a Keystone STARS 3- or 4-star rating). Every census block group in the\
    \ city of Philadelphia has multiple supply, demand and shortage measures. Each\
    \ of the shortage measures is instructive of the nature of the required programmatic\
    \ or investment activity (e.g., invest in getting existing uncertified supply\
    \ certified, upgrading existing certified supply, creating new high-quality supply).\r\
    \n\r\nFor a more detailed description of the data and methodology, please see\
    \ TRF\u2019s forthcoming childcare report.\r\n\r\nCensus: Decennial Census and\
    \ American Community Survey\r\nFor a detailed description of the census sources\
    \ used in this mapping tool, including the difference between the decennial census\
    \ and the American Community Survey as well as how percent change calculations\
    \ are done between various years, please see the census entry in PolicyMap\u2019\

notes: "Childcare Map helps Philadelphians make decisions about childcare.\r\n\r\n\
  Collection Process: TRF culled childcare data for the City of Philadelphia from\
  \ various sources, and incorporated data from the Census related to demographics,\
  \ income, poverty, and transportation. TRF also gathered overlays of various city\
  \ boundaries from OpenDataPhilly and other local sources. More information on sources\
  \ is available at http://www.policymap.com/files/ChildcareMapDataDirectory.pdf.\r\
  \n\r\nData Purpose:  TRF collected the data to provide as clear a picture as possible\
  \ of the supply of and demand for childcare in the city, and to better understand\
  \ where the gaps are so that stakeholders can work to address them.\r\nIntended\
  \ Audience:  Childcare providers, investors, policy makers, and parents.\r\nWhy\
  \ Collected:  High-quality childcare supports positive child development and prepares\
  \ children for success in school and beyond.  As such, accessing high-quality care\
  \ is important for the well-being of neighborhoods and families.  By identifying\
  \ areas where shortages of high-quality childcare exist, policymakers and investors\
  \ can work towards increasing access for all."
