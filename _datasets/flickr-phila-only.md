notes: Flick is an online, interactive photo database, where users can search for
  photographs by thematic descriptors and locations through the mapping application.
  Thematic descriptors include mood/visual keywords, tags, and account names of photographers,
  collectors, or other viewers who upload photos to the database. Photo-data is also
  accessible to users through a feed (RSS) that yields recent, exportable photo uploads,
  and an API. With free registration, users can also upload their own photos, create
  profiles, edit, comment, and participate in forum/group culture.
