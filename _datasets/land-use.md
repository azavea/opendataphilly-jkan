  \ or units of land. Land use is the type of activity occurring on the land such\
  \ as residential, commercial or industrial. Each unit of land is assigned one of\
  \ nine major classifications of land use (2-digit code), and where possible a more\
  \ narrowly defined sub-classification (3-digit code). The land use feature class\
  \ has been field checked and corrected for the following Planning Districts. \r\n\
